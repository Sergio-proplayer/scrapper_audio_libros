{"titulo":"En honor al Espiritu Santo [In Honor of the Holy Spirit]: No es un algo, es un alguien!","imagen":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512InfYWTLL.jpg","descripcion":"The author based the contents of this book on his personal experience. His own life became a comprehensive model for learning about the power of the Holy Spirit and how He can work in the lives of individuals. There is no other published work that tells his story about the anointing and power that made him grow as a person, pastor, and leader of a 20,000-member church in Guatemala. \nThis book is for everyone because it is written in a simple style, employing user-friendly language that makes the message accessible to every listener who desires to know the Holy Spirit and His anointing without requiring denominational or religious affiliations, a high level of theological knowledge, or personal church commitments. \n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/En-honor-Espiritu-Santo-audiolibro/dp/B00DGFON3G/ref=sr_1_312","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B00DGFON3G?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
