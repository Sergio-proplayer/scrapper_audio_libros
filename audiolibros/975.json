{"titulo":"Hasta que alguien me escuche [Until Someone Listens]: Una historia sobre las fronteras, la familia y la misión de una niña","imagen":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01RmK+J4pJL.gif","descripcion":"When Estela Juarez's mom is deported to Mexico, Estela knows she has to speak up for her family. Told in Estela's own words, Until Someone Listens is a true story about a young girl finding her voice and using it to make change.  Estela’s family lives together in a happy home full of love. Or, at least, they used to… until their home was torn apart.  My mom had to go back, to the other side of the river, because she wasn’t born in this country.  For years her family fought and fought for permission for her to stay in the U.S. But no one listened. When Estela was eight, her mother was deported to Mexico.  Estela knew she had to do something. So she wrote letters: to local newspapers, Congress, the President, and anyone else who could help. She wrote and wrote and wrote until, finally… someone listened.  In this heart wrenching, autobiographical story, Estela Juarez's letters take her from the local news all the way to the national stage, where she discovers the power in her words and pledges to keep using her voice until her family—and others like hers—are together again.\n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/dp/B0BGMX7HGG/ref=sr_1_144","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B0BGMX7HGG?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
