Four years later, in this midst of his great sadness, Mack receives a suspicious note, apparently from God, inviting him back to that shack for a weekend.  \nAgainst his better judgment, he arrives at the shack on wintry afternoon and walks back into his darkest nightmare. What he finds there will change his life forever.\nIn an age where religion seems to grow increasingly irrelevant, The Shack wrestles with the timeless question: Where is God in a world so filled with unspeakable pain? The answers that astounded and transformed Mack finds will do the same for listeners.\nPlease note: This title is in Spanish.\n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/La-Cabana-audiolibro/dp/B001OR73XA/ref=sr_1_221","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B001OR73XA?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
