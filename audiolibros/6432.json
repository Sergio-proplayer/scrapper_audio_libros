Kurdish is a continuum of Northwestern Iranian languages spoken by the Kurds in Western Asia. Our Kurdish is a dialect known as Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji). Native speakers : around 30 millions. How to learn a language differently? Today, language learning is revolutionizing: you do not have to go to traditional language classes anymore. Our learning method: a selection of hundreds of phrases and essential words. You listen to them, you repeat them, and you speak. We rely on pronunciation, oral rehearsal, listening, combined with words, essential phrases, and a vocabulary list. 20% of the words are used 80% of the time. The end goal is to get a sufficient level in one language to be able to hold simple conversations, to be able to understand simple exchanges, deal with with everyday life and start exploring the new culture that opens up to you.\nLorsque vous achetez ce titre, le fichier PDF qui l'accompagne sera disponible dans votre confirmation d'achat envoyée par mail ainsi que dans votre bibliothèque, depuis votre ordinateur.\n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/Estoy-aprendiendo-kurdo-audiolibro/dp/B07KXTQGL5/ref=sr_1_861","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B07KXTQGL5?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
