{"titulo":"Skeletina y el Entremundo [Skeletina and the In-Between World]","imagen":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01RmK+J4pJL.gif","descripcion":"Inspired by Mexican culture and perfect for fans of the hit movies Coco and The Nightmare Before Christmas, Skeletina and the In-Between World is the first book in a series that combines kooky characters and a spooky story with important and resonant themes about empathy, bravery, self-esteem, and the enduring power of love. \nMeet Skeletina, a fun-loving, fearless little girl who lives in the in-between world with her friends, who include monsters, creatures, ghosts, and more. The upside-down, inside-out, in-between world is where the living go when they are fast asleep and where the dead hang out when they have unfinished business. Visitors to the in-between world are children who come to confront their fears or to see a loved one who has recently left the world of the living. Either way, Skeletina is there to guide them and help children conquer their anxieties.\n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/dp/B0BFFKS4T6/ref=sr_1_1088","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B0BFFKS4T6?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
