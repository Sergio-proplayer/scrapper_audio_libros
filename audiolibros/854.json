{"titulo":"Cajas de Carton","imagen":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41xhdQa+UOL.jpg","descripcion":"In Spanish. Francisco Jiménez writes of his childhood growing up in an immigrant Mexican family. His narrative is simple, as from a child's point of view, but that same simplicity packs the power of a highly skilled storyteller. \nBeautifully and authentically rendered by actor and playwright Adrian Vargas, these 12 stories tell of the almost unendurable journey most migrant campesinos undertake to find the American Dream. The recording concludes with an afterword recorded by the author. Cajas de Cartón is also available in English as The Circuit.\n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/Cajas-Carton-audiolibro/dp/B00005AANY/ref=sr_1_23","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B00005AANY?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
