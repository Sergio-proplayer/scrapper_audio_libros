When the sounds of the coquíes gradually return, they reflect the resilience and strength of Elena, her family, and her fellow Puerto Ricans.\nThe Coquies Still Sing is also available in Spanish.\nA Macmillan Audio production from Roaring Brook Press.\n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/dp/B0BFC3GCDX/ref=sr_1_1092","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B0BFC3GCDX?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
