{"titulo":"Dividend Investment: Comprehensive Beginners Guide to Learn Dividend Investing Step by Step (Spanish Edition)","imagen":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51g802-vytL.jpg","descripcion":"Building wealth toward retirement and finally enjoying the fruits of decades of labor seems more difficult these days. Maybe it’s because of inflation (higher prices) for health care, education, costs of living, rent, and so many other necessary expenses.\nWhen our parents were working, big and stable pensions were the norm. If you worked hard and stayed with a company for many decades, you would be rewarded with a hefty pension. Well, unfortunately, those days are over.\nCompanies are cutting costs anywhere they can, to show better profits. Unfortunately, for this generation, we must take retirement in our own hands.\nNow, that may seem daunting, but if you save money, you must invest it properly. You can outperform any pension that your parents or grandparents own/owned.\nI know what you’re thinking. It seems almost impossible to save for retirement. You barely get any interest in your bank account. I don’t know about you, but I’m getting less than 0.1 percent interest in my saving account!\nGiven this problem, let me ask you three questions:\n\nSome of you might think that it’s a super-secretive strategy that only hedge funds or the ultra-wealthy top 1 percent have access to. That’s not true at all!\nWith enough learning and research, you too can implement this strategy and really change your life.\nAll right, ready for this amazing investing strategy? It is called dividend investing.\nThis isn’t some magical formula to get rich quick. It takes years to build a well-diversified portfolio that will perform well in all market environments. And it requires periodic portfolio monitoring to make sure things are running smoothly. \n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/dp/B07TJBQZ6P/ref=sr_1_478","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B07TJBQZ6P?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
