This book takes the listener on a journey to evaluate clues given in the Bible, ancient archaeology, and Sumerian texts written in code 4,000 years ago. These clues shake the foundations of conventional science, history and religion.\nAdam Decoded invites the listener to participate in solving the age-long question of man's origin. Who are we? Where are we from? Who really were Adam and Eve, and where is the Garden of Eden?\nThis book, the long-awaited sequel to Adam = Alien, helps to decode the past using credible photographic and written texts. This code brings to light many unearthed principles hidden from our common education system, that makes the listener think critically about our accepted theory of evolution, the creation of unexplainable pyramids and monoliths, and our rapid and sudden development in brain capacity. The clues are woven within the framework of the book to unravel this 4,000 year old secret.\nThe answer to the puzzle lies right under our skin - the Adam Code.\n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/dp/B07SQBFBTL/ref=sr_1_1068","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B07SQBFBTL?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
