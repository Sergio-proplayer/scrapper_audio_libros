A stunningly fresh narrative that begins just as Trump's second year as president is getting underway and ends with the delivery of the Mueller report, Siege reveals an administration that is perpetually beleaguered by investigations and a president who is increasingly volatile, erratic, and exposed.\n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/Asedio-audiolibro/dp/B07T7XJVCX/ref=sr_1_713","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B07T7XJVCX?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
