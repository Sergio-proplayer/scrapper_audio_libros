{"titulo":"Mastering Spanish Words: Increase Your Vocabulary with over 3000 Spanish Words in Context","imagen":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jzrw47nTL.jpg","descripcion":"How many words do we use when we speak? According to some publications, while a two-year-old baby uses around 200 words, a beginner in any language needs around 2,000 to communicate. And an expert user can employ up to 40,000! But knowing words and their meanings is hardly enough.\nIf you want to learn Spanish to actually use it, be it for traveling, working, or studying, you need to really master your vocabulary. You need to know synonyms, you need to know which prepositions are used next to which verbs, and how words change their meaning in different contexts.\nIn this audiobook, we offer a comprehensive list of the 3,000 most frequent words of the Spanish language, according to the Real Academia Española, Spain's official royal institution dedicated to the Spanish language. We did not just include the words and their meanings, but also eventual indications for you to understand the use of the word since translations are otherwise incomplete.\nFor example, we indicate if it’s a masculine or feminine word, if it’s a plural word, and if it belongs to a verbal tense that does not translate literally into English. Additionally, we indicate if the word has more than one meaning, so you can avoid confusion. And, of course, for each word we include a practical example - a sentence that, in a few words, tells a story and helps you understand how the word is used in the real Spanish-speaking world.\nBy the time you’re finished with this audiobook, your vocabulary will be comparably better, richer, and wider. Ready to give it a go? Start right away! You’ll feel the difference...and everyone else will notice, too!\nScroll up and click the “buy now” button now to get started!\nPLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.\n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/dp/B08B3PF8QK/ref=sr_1_19","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B08B3PF8QK?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
