{"titulo":"In Search of Emma En busca de Emma (Spanish Edition): Cómo creamos nuestra familia","imagen":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51nFiZ3S9KL.jpg","descripcion":"Searching for Emma Spa\nEn busca de Emma is the moving story of two fathers that overcame all obstacles to bring their daughter into this world. A personal story of the building of a 21st-century family. A universal story of love. This is the first book from the editor in chief of People en Español.\nAs the editor in chief of People en Español, the highest circulated Spanish-language magazine in the USA, Armando Correa knows a thing or two about glitz, celebrity, and glamour. Yet, missing from his life was the family he so yearned to create; the family that thanks to science, patience, and the most supportive community possible, he was finally able to bring into existence in his beautiful daughter Emma.\nUsing the trying, and costly, method of finding a surrogate to give birth to his daughter, listeners come to know just how difficult a process it is for anyone wanting to become a parent. Blessed with a long-term partner, we see Armando’s hopes dashed time and again when the pregnancy fails to take. Until finally, the pregnancy does take, and their lives become filled with the expectations all parents feel (layered with nervousness, fear, absolute love) when their unborn baby is on the way.\nThe book is at once a beautiful and timely story told from the perspective of a man who always wanted to become a father, and whose understanding that his family may not be considered traditional in some circles is in part the fuel that drives him.\n","link_init":"https://amazon.com/-/es/dp/B08WRP41R8/ref=sr_1_45","link_final":"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mfpdp/B08WRP41R8?actionCode=AMSTM1450129210001"}
